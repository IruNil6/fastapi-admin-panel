# Reporting Security Issues
If you think you have discovered a security vulnerability, I recommend that you inform me immediately.

I will examine all reliable reports and do my best to fix the problem quickly.

I would prefer that you use the vulnerability reporting feature on GitHub to identify potential vulnerabilities in my open source software. To do this, please go to the "Security" tab in the repository and click the "Report vulnerability" button.
